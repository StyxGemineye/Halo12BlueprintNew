Halo12BlueprintNew: A Scalable Energy and BCI Platform Halo12BlueprintNew is a $10,000 technology integrating non-invasive NeuroGen (BCI) and microfusion-inspired energy systems. NeuroGen, built on EEG-based brain-computer interfaces, enables real-time neural data processing, displaying physiological states (heart rate, neural activity) via a wearable halo device with LED feedback. The energy system leverages fusion principles, using compact, high-efficiency plasma containment inspired by tokamak designs, aiming for sustainable, low-cost power. Foamed glass structures, engineered for thermal and structural stability, form scalable habitats. The platform’s AI, coded in Python, coordinates neural and energy systems, drawing on existing neural network frameworks. This unproven yet feasible design builds on ITER’s fusion research and BCI advancements, targeting a prototype for energy-efficient, neural-integrated habitats. Developers and physicists: contribute to this repo to refine plasma containment algorithms, optimize NeuroGen signal processing, or design foamed glass architecture. Test scalability and efficiency to realize a transformative energy-BCI ecosystem. Explore this repo or contact StyxGemineye to collaborate.
